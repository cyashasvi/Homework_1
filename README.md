# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Purpose: 
The main goal of this project was to make minor changes and improvements to the overall HTML and CSS for HORSEON's website. There were many
repititions in the code, so the biggest task involved "cutting the fat" and making sure that the overall files were performing exactly the 
same with less code in each file. 

Changes I made to the document: 
1. I commented and separated each div, and described what each div was doing.
2. Each change is also commented, so that there is an understanding of what the code was like before.
3. Added alt text to all images to allow for web accessibility.
4. Created a root in the CSS fie and created a variable for fonts to enable quick changes. 
5. Deleted any additional code - 
    a. For example, the three mini containers in the sidebar and the three main containers of information on the HORISEON page all had 
    their own respective classes while they were all doing the same thing. I kept only one of the classes, and deleted the rest to make
    the code more efficient.
